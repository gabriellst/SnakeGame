# Snake Game in Python

This project was developed with the intention of recreating the classic Nokia Snake Game and to practice Object Oriented Programming. 

It's a very simple project, there's nothing different from the original, if you have had an experience with this game, you'll be nostalgic.


## Besides that, i made it using python code and python libraries, and that's pretty cool!

### You can move the snake by pressing the WASD keys, and the objective is to eat as much *yellow dots* as possible, AKA food.



## Libraries used

* Turtle
* Random
* Time
